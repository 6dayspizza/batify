        <p id="broken-bones">what should I do if I detect broken bones?</p>
        <div class="faq">
            if there are any broken bones involved, call the vet, no matter what
            day or time.

        <div class="faq">
            store it in one of the boxes with the usual supplies. add some of
            the buffalo worms, in case it gets hungry. stick a note to the box
            that you were not able to finish the examination. important: if you
            can spot some blood and/or broken bones, don't just leave it in the
            box, but also call the vet.

        <p id="sticky-bat">that bat looks somewhat (or very) sticky.</p>
        <div class="faq">
            there is an emergency-cleanup-kit in the cupboard. use the linseed
            oil to gently rub the stickiness out of its fur. then, use the baby
            shampoo to remove the oil. repeat process, until bat returns to its
            usual fluffy self.

            just continue the registration without filling that part in.
            fortunately, for bats it doesn't really matter for the care
            instructions if it's a boy or a girl. :]

        <div class="faq">
            there is a conversion table for mealworms to buffalos, and back. you
            can also consider the automatic conversion rate given when you fill
            in the form.

        <p id="worm-awareness">I feel a bit bad for the worms...</p>
        <div class="faq">
            as of yet, we don't know everything about mealworms that is there to
            know. it is said that they have a "very simple" nervous system. it
            is believed to be so simple, that you can cut them apart, and the
            individual parts will still continue to function. that is why we
            often can still see them move, although they are beheaded. there is
            no definite answer to whether they perceive pain the same way we do.
            for this reason, we aim to kill them as quickly as possible. that
            they have some sort of awareness as to what's about to happen to
            them, is highly doubtable.

        <p id="vegetarian-alternative">
            is there any vegetarian alternative we could feed the bats?
        </p>
        <div class="faq">
            no, unfortunately there isn't. out there, our local bats have a very
            exclusive diet. it's insects. they eat between 1500 and 2500
            specimens per night. as it is not possible for us to feed them that
            amount of insects per day in our station, we give them mealworms
            instead. this diet has proven to be successful.
